> GeoLocation module for react-native

The behavior of the default geolocation module included with `react-native`, `navigator.geolocation`, is not always obvious and does not meet our use-case for [mapeo-mobile](www.github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile). We needed the following features:

-   Initial position using non-GPS (cell towers, wifi) so that the app works indoors in cities
-   Continued GPS aquisition until the accuracy is below a defined threshold
-   Updated GPS positon when the use moves
-   Updates to the GPS status when location services are turned on or off whilst the app is open (e.g. airplane mode turned on)

`navigator.geolocation` will only sometimes throw an error when location serivces are turned off, and will not always get a new location when they are turned on again. This module uses the following strategy:

1.  Asks for the necessary permissions for using fine and coarse location
2.  Gets an initial position with `highAccuracy: false` and uses a cached position if a recent one exists
3.  In parallel also starts observing the position with `highAccuracy: true`, with `distanceFilter: 0` which will continuously update the location every 1000ms in testing
4.  Once the accuracy is below a threshold, turns off the continuous watch and starts a new watch with a distance filter, so the location will stop updating every 1000ms and only update when the user moves beyond the threshold distance

## Install

You will need to install and link the peer dependecy react-native-gps-state

```sh
npm install -S @digidem/react-native-geolocation
npm install -S react-native-gps-state
npm link react-native-gps-state
```

## Usage

```js
const GeoLocation = require('@digidem/react-native-geolocation')

const loc = new GeoLocation()
loc.startObserving(
  (position) => console.log(position),
  (err) => console.log(err)
)
// call loc.stopObserving() to stop receiving location updates
```

### GeoLocation

Create a new geolocation instance

#### Parameters

-   `options` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** [not yet implemented]

#### Examples

```javascript
const loc = new GeoLocation()
```

#### startObserving

Request permissions and start observing the location.

`Position.status` is an `unsigned short` representing the status:

| Value | Associated Constant         | Description                                                     |
| ----- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`   | `GeoLocation.SEARCHING`     | GPS is searching for a location fix                             |
| `2`   | `GeoLocation.LOW_ACCURACY`  | Low accuracy position, continuing to search for better accuracy |
| `3`   | `GeoLocation.HIGH_ACCURACY` | High accuracy position, will only update if use moves           |

`PositionError.code` is an `unsigned short` representing the error:

| Value | Associated Constant                | Description                                                                         |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`   | `GeoLocation.PERMISSION_DENIED`    | Location acquisition failed because the app does not have permission                |
| `2`   | `GeoLocation.POSITION_UNAVAILABLE` | Location acquisition failed because location services are turned off or unavailable |
| `3`   | `GeoLocation.TIMEOUT`              | Timeout was reached before a location was found                                     |
| `4`   | `GeoLocation.UNKNOWN`              | Unknown error occured trying to acquire location                                    |

##### Parameters

-   `onLocation` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Called with every location update, _including_
    when searching for a location, but no position is available. Returns a
    [Position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Position)
    object with an additional property `status` (see above)
-   `onError` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Called every time there is an error (failed to
    get position) with a
    [PositionError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PositionError)
    object with an additional `PositionError.code` (see above)

#### stopObserving

Stop observing the location
